    - DONE - Make home base. The base you start at but does nothing for you except fill you up 
      and fix your repairs for cheap. Landing back here at any time does nothing. 
      Perhaps it will adomonish you or something

    Actually, make landing there fill and repair at the discounted cost, as if a shift ended

    - Sort upgrades so you get 3 good ones, and the most affordable first.
      I realise this will eventually force you to buy cheap upgrades you may not want
      but it is part of the economy, and I can even build it into corporate culture with
      aphorisms

    - Make upgrades you can't afford red with a red aura, and not choosable, but you CAN see them

    - Make negative cash red.

    - Put in a physics cone to the rear that stops buildings from blocking your view.
      Do this by having a collision thing that turns the building you collide with transparent
      by swapping out materials. While colliding, swap it with a temp Alpha version of the same
      material, and then swap it back when you are no longer colliding with it

    APHORISMS: 

    If you or your family suffers a medical crisis while you are in Huver's emply, don't worry.
    We have a Family Leave program. It's Leave.

    Don't worry, Pilot. Huver will let you hold a deficit balance. You can work it off.
    But you can't buy an upgrade unless you can afford it.

    Huver cares about you, Pilot 149-673-3719. Pilots are our existence!
    We are nothing without your warm body in our seat.

    Don't jostle the customers! Your tip depends on it!

    Watch that fuel! If you run out, it would be an insurance
    nightmare!

    Huver invests in you! Fuel and repairs at a Huver Home Base is always discounted!

    Your radar is your frenemy!

    Aphorisms are good for the soul. Good for company morale. Good for the spreadsheets.

    Cash in the red? Don't worry. Huvver cares about you, Pilot 149-673-3719! You can work it off!

    ANother shift, another ($)

    Your full manual is under the rear passenger seat.

    Crashed? Shit happens! You just pay your deductible and move on. You can always work it off.

    Oh no! Crash! Know what? Bygones. Decutible is $500 and it's all water under the bridgework.

    (At the beginning of the game, input name, then NEVER USE IT!)

    At Huver, we care about you. Input your name.
    Welcome, Pilot 149-673-3719!

    (However, the name is in the save file filename.)

    The smart money upgrades to Strafe early, because it's all about control... right Pilot #149-673-3719?

    Turbo Boost can really save you some $heckles
